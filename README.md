This repository contains over 200 [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) signature modules from the community, including
those heavily modified by Optiv for correctness, removal of false positives,
and more detailed information.  It also includes over 70 new signature modules
developed solely by Optiv and provided under the GPL.

Please note that many of these signature modules make use of Optiv's extensive
improvements to both Cuckoo and cuckoomon and are noted accordingly as requiring
Cuckoo version "1.2".

If you have signature modules to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests or
email brad.spengler@optiv.com.
